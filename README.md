### Insights and Recommendations
Inorder to improve “Dominos” Sales & Profits :
- Since **maximum orders are on Monday indepth analysis should be done** to figure out the possible root cause and further strategy should be made.
- For the **weekends i.e. Saturday & Sunday more offers should be rolled out** to further increase the sales of pizza.
- Since **'Classic' category & 'Large' size are the most preffered** customer choice, special attention should be given to them with **100% stock availability**, in order to maintain customer satisfaction with Dominos store.
- Similarly **'The Thai Chicken Pizza' & 'The Classic Delux Pizza' are the most preffered** customer choice, therefore **special attention** should be given to them with **100% stock availability**.
- **'The Brie Carre Pizza' is the least preffered choice** of customers, therefore **customer feedbacks** can be taken for this to know the root cause (if any).
