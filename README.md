### Recommendations
Inorder to improve “SuperStore” Sales & Profits :
- **California in west and New York in east US should be analysed** specifically to look what's driving the higher sales in these states and the same should be used to revive sales in the Northern and Southern states of the country.
- In terms of payment modes, major spending should be done in **maintaining the Online & Cash On Delivery customers like more cash back schemes,sales offs on transactions** etc can be given.
- **Year end (specially December) is witnessing higher sales, so more offers should be rolled off** during that period of the year. Also, further analysis should be done to generate more profit from the increased sales during that period.
- **Office Supplies & Technologies inventories should always be maintained** properly as they the majority contributors to sales and profits. Also more schemes should be provided to their buyers. In addition to this, **feeback form can be rolled out to the customers of 'Furniture' to see their pain point** and plan further strategies accordingly.
- Since more customers are using **Shipment mode as Standard Class**, if possible, **try to reduce the delivery time period** which is currently 6 days.
- **As per the forecasted values, stocks should be maintained in advance** specially for demanding item categories like Office Supplies & Technologies.
